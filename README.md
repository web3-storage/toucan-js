# toucan-js

**Toucan** is a [Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io/) client for [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) written in TypeScript.

- **Reliable**: In Cloudflare Workers isolate model, it is inadvisable to [set or mutate global state within the event handler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/about/how-it-works). Toucan was created with Workers' concurrent model in mind. No race-conditions, no undelivered logs, no nonsense metadata in Sentry.
- **Flexible:** Supports `fetch` and `scheduled` Workers, their `.mjs` equivalents, and `Durable Objects`.
- **Familiar API:** Follows [Sentry unified API guidelines](https://docs.sentry.io/development/sdk-dev/unified-api/).

## Usage

```
npm install --save toucan-js
```

### FetchEvent

```ts
import Toucan from 'toucan-js';

addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  const sentry = new Toucan({
    dsn: 'dsn...',
    context: event, // Includes 'waitUntil', which is essential for Sentry logs to be delivered. Also includes 'request' -- no need to set it separately.
    allowedHeaders: ['user-agent'],
    allowedSearchParams: /(.*)/,
  });

  sentry.setUser({ id: '1234' });

  event.respondWith(async () => {
    try {
      // Your code

      return new Response('OK', {
        status: 200,
        statusText: 'OK',
      });
    } catch (err) {
      sentry.captureException(err);
      return new Response('Something went wrong', {
        status: 500,
        statusText: 'Internal Server Error',
      });
    }
  });
});
```

### ScheduledEvent

```ts
import Toucan from 'toucan-js';

addEventListener('scheduled', (event) => {
  const sentry = new Toucan({
    dsn: 'dsn...',
    context: event, // Includes 'waitUntil', which is essential for Sentry logs to be delivered. Note that there's no request in 'scheduled' events context.
  });

  event.waitUntil(async () => {
    try {
      // Your code
    } catch (err) {
      sentry.captureException(err);
    }
  });
});
```

### Equivalent of above as a module (.mjs)

```ts
import Toucan from 'toucan-js';

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, context: Context) {
    const sentry = new Toucan({
      dsn: 'dsn...',
      context, // Includes 'waitUntil', which is essential for Sentry logs to be delivered. Modules workers do not include 'request' in context -- you'll need to set it separately.
      request, // request is not included in 'context', so we set it here.
      allowedHeaders: ['user-agent'],
      allowedSearchParams: /(.*)/,
    });

    try {
      // Your code

      return new Response('OK', {
        status: 200,
        statusText: 'OK',
      });
    } catch (err) {
      sentry.captureException(err);
      return new Response('Something went wrong', {
        status: 500,
        statusText: 'Internal Server Error',
      });
    }
  },
  async scheduled(controller: Controller, env: Env, context: Context) {
    const sentry = new Toucan({
      dsn: 'dsn...',
      context, // Includes 'waitUntil', which is essential for Sentry logs to be delivered. Note that there's no request in 'scheduled' events context.
    });

    context.waitUntil(async () => {
      try {
        // Your code
      } catch (err) {
        sentry.captureException(err);
      }
    });
  },
};
```

### Durable Objects

```ts
import Toucan from 'toucan-js';

export class DurableObjectExample {
  state: DurableObjectState;

  constructor(state: DurableObjectState, env: Env) {
    this.state = state;

    // You're not going to instantiate toucan-js here, because that would lead to race-conditions.
  }

  async fetch(request: Request) {
    // Note that we do not need to set 'context' here -- in Durable Objects it is not necessary to explicitly call 'waitUntil' to extend runtime - Durable Objects make sure that all I/O is finished before deconstructing. 'waitUntil' in Durable Objects only exists for backwards compatibility.
    const sentry = new Toucan({
      dsn: 'dsn...',
      request,
      allowedHeaders: ['user-agent'],
      allowedSearchParams: /(.*)/,
      context: this.state, // OPTIONAL: 'context' really isn't necessary in Durable Objects -- as mentioned above, we don't need 'waitUntil' for 'toucan-js' to successfully deliver logs to Sentry. If you provide 'context', 'toucan-js' will call 'waitUntil' instead of just calling 'fetch'. No difference.
    });

    try {
      // your code

      return new Response('OK', {
        status: 200,
        statusText: 'OK',
      });
    } catch (err) {
      sentry.captureException(err);
      return new Response('Something went wrong', {
        status: 500,
        statusText: 'Internal Server Error',
      });
    }
  }
}
```

## Features

- addBreadcumb: Records a new breadcrumb which will be attached to future events.
- captureException: Captures an exception event and sends it to Sentry.
- captureMessage: Captures a message event and sends it to Sentry.
- setRequestBody: Records incoming request's body which will be attached to future events.
- setTag: Set key:value that will be sent as tags data with the event.
- setTags: Set an object that will be merged sent as tags data with the event.
- setExtra: Set key:value that will be sent as extra data with the event.
- setExtras: Set an object that will be merged sent as extra data with the event.
- setUser: Updates user context information for future events.

## Sensitive data

By default, Toucan does not send any Request property that could carry [PII (Personally Identifiable Information)](https://docs.sentry.io/data-management/sensitive-data/) to Sentry.

This includes:

- All request Headers
- All request Cookies
- All request search params
- Request body

You will need to explicitly allow these data using:

- allowedHeaders option (array of headers or Regex)
- allowedCookies option (array of cookies or Regex)
- allowedSearchParams option (array of search params or Regex)
- toucan.setRequestBody function
- beforeSend option (if you need more flexibility than allowedX functions)

## Known issues

### Source Maps

Make sure to use the absolute paths on the stack frames and Sentry's artifacts, the default `~/` will not match them properly. Any absolute path will work (i.e., `/`). You will need to use `rewriteFrames` option to add the prefix to the stack frames.

```ts
const toucan = new Toucan({
  dsn: ...
  event,
  rewriteFrames: {
    root: '/'
  }
}
```

Changing the Sentry's artifacts URL depends on plugin you use to upload your source maps.

Example configuration using `@sentry/webpack-plugin`:

```ts
const SentryWebpackPlugin = require('@sentry/webpack-plugin');
const pkg = require('./package.json');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  target: 'webworker',
  devtool: 'source-map',
  plugins: [
    new SentryWebpackPlugin({
      release: `${pkg.name}-${pkg.version}`,
      include: './dist',
      urlPrefix: '/',
    }),
  ],
};
```
